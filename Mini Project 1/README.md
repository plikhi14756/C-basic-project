Project title - Mini Project 1 (Stone, Paper and Scissors Game)

Created by - Pranav Likhi

Made using - C language

Project Details: This project basically a simple game of Stone , Paper and Scissors which we all play everyday with each other So the special feture that i have added in this project is that in this project we get a choice whether the user wants to play the game with the computer or wants to play with his friend/other person. 

Special Feature - So playing with computer means that everytime you will play with the computer he will always generate a random output and at the end of the game the user will get the reasult whether the user wins or the computer wins and same thing will happen when the user will try to play with the another user/player/friend or anyone else

** Exceptional case - The output of the computer will not be visible to the user he will only get the result eithe he wins or loose or its a draw **
